<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I set up and configured an Active Directory environment integrated with Microsoft Azure. I began by creating and managing multiple user accounts, ensuring each had the appropriate permissions for accessing resources. To enhance security and streamline user management, I connected an on-premises domain controller to Azure Active Directory. This integration enabled hybrid identity management, allowing users to authenticate across both cloud and on-premises environments seamlessly. The setup provided centralized control over user access, improving both security and operational efficiency for managing IT resources.
